<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Binary exploitation is a core tenet of penetration testing, but learning it can be daunting. This is mainly due to the complexity of binary files and their underlying machine code and how binary files interact with computer memory and the processor. To learn the basics of binary exploitation, we must first have a firm grasp of Computer Architecture and the Assembly Language. To move into more advanced binary exploitation, we must have a firm grasp on basic buffer overflow attacks, principles such as CPU architecture, and CPU registers for 32-bit Windows and Linux systems. Furthermore, a strong foundation in Python scripting is essential for writing and understanding exploit scripts.</p>

<h2>Modules</h2>
<p>Introduction to Python 3, Intro to Assembly Language, Stack-based Buffer Overflows on Linux x86, Stack-Based Buffer Overflows on Windows x86</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Introduction to Python 3</li>
    <p>Automating tedious or otherwise impossible tasks is highly valued during both penetration testing engagements and everyday life. Introduction to Python 3 aims to introduce the student to the world of scripting with Python 3 and covers the essential building blocks needed for a beginner to understand programming. Some advanced topics are also covered for the more experienced student. In a guided fashion and starting soft, the final goal of this module is to equip the reader with enough know-how to be able to implement simple yet useful pieces of software.</p>
    <li>Intro to Assembly Language</li>
    <p>This module builds the core foundation for Binary Exploitation by teaching Computer Architecture and Assembly language basics.</p>
    <li>Stack-based Buffer Overflows on Linux x86</li>
    <p>Buffer overflows are common vulnerabilities in software applications that can be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE) or perform a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. These vulnerabilities are caused by insecure coding, resulting in an attacker being able to overrun a program's buffer and overwrite adjacent memory locations, changing the program's execution path and resulting in unintended actions.</p>
    <li>Stack-Based Buffer Overflows on Windows x86</li>
    <p>This module is your first step into Windows Binary Exploitation, and it will teach you how to exploit local and remote buffer overflow vulnerabilities on Windows machines.</p>
