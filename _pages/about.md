Ahoy hoy! 

I am a passionate cybersecurity researcher with three years of hands-on experience. My primary focus lies in securing web applications, where I strive to stay ahead of potential threats and protect users' data.

But my true passion is reverse engineering. I love the challenge of deconstructing code, understanding its inner workings, and uncovering vulnerabilities that others might miss. This intricate process not only sharpens my skills but also fuels my curiosity and drives me to learn more.

In addition to my professional work, I enjoy participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and solving various online boxes to keep my skills sharp and my mind agile. These exercises not only help me stay on top of the latest trends in cybersecurity but also allow me to connect with a vibrant community of like-minded individuals.

When I'm not diving into the depths of code, you can find me exploring the latest advancements in cybersecurity and contributing to open-source projects. My commitment to continuous learning and growth ensures that I remain at the forefront of this ever-evolving field.
